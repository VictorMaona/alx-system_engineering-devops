##Attack is the best defense

Penetration testing and ethical hacking should only be carried out on
networks and systems for which you have been granted express authorization.
Make responsible use of the information while abiding by the law and
moral principles.
Docker containers offer a regulated testing environment that makes 
sure your actions don't affect the larger system or network.
