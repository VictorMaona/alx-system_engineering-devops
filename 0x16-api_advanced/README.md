## 0x16. API advanced

work project pertaining to Python's advanced API usage. 
The project focuses on practicing using the Reddit API and 
seeks to enhance your abilities to handle pagination, read
API documentation, parse JSON results, make recursive API calls,
and sort dictionaries based on value. With this sophisticated project,
I practiced accessing APIs once more, using the Reddit API this time.
