##0x13. Firewall

This project, written by Holberton School co-founder Sylvain Kalache, 
dealt with firewalls and web stack debugging. Working with firewalls, 
comprehending web stack debugging, and running telnet tests to
determine whether specific ports are open are all part of the project.

Using a bash script, a web server's ufw firewall is installed, blocking all incoming traffic except for ports 22, 443, and 80.


100-port_forwarding: 
A firewall can be configured to reroute port 8080/TCP to port 80/TCP using the ufw configuration file.
