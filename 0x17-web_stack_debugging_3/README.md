## 0x17. Web stack debugging #3


Debugging a WordPress website that is hosted on a LAMP stack is the focus of this project. 
Finding and fixing problems that interfere with the website's functionality is the main 
objective. The web stack consists of PHP, MySQL, Apache, and Linux.

## Requirements

- **Files Format:** manifest files for Puppet that end in.pp



## Debugging Process

1. **Identify Issues:**
   - Recognize the particular issues that the WordPress website is facing..

2. **Logs and Debugging:**
   - Examine logs for insights.
   - Debugging involves working your way down the stack to identify and fix problems..

3. **Puppet Manifests:**
   - Use Puppet to handle configurations.
   - To configure and maintain the LAMP stack, create manifests.


This web stack debugging project was the fourth in a series. For these projects, 
I was entrusted with repairing damaged or problematic web stacks in isolated containers
and getting them back up and running. I created a script that automates the 
instructions required to fix the web stack for each activity.
