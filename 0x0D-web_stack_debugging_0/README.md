##0x0D. Web stack debugging #0

Finding and fixing problems in the front end (client-side) 
and back end (server-side) of a web application are all part
 of debugging a web stack. 

This web stack debugging project was the first of many. For 
these projects, I was tasked with repairing broken or problematic
web stacks in isolated containers and getting them back up and
running. I created a script that automates the commands
required to fix the web stack for each task.
