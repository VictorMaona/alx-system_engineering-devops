##0x12. Web stack debugging #2

This web stack debugging project was the third in a series. For 
these projects, I was entrusted with repairing damaged or
problematic web stacks in isolated containers and getting them 
back up and running. I created a script that automates the
instructions required to fix the web stack for each activity.
