##0x1A. Application server

This was our AirBnB clone's application deployment project. For this project, I set up Nginx on the web servers that ALX gave me, allowing it to serve a WSGI Flask application that was using Gunicorn. I also configured an Upstart script to maintain the application's operation throughout server reboots.
